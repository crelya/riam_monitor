# Rasp in a Maze Monitor (RIAM Monitor)
*A project by Rodrigo Crespo & Meriem El Yamri*

This project is the monitor of the project Rasp in a Maze, 
a hardware+software project where two or more motorized raspberries work together to get out of a maze, 
using a **distributed backtracking algorithm**.

To make it work with the app, you need to install the server in your Raspberry Pi devices as well:
